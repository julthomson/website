## Athletics

As a Division I track and field athlete, I competed in the throwing events at **Dartmouth College** and later as a graduate transfer at **Villanova University**. My time in collegiate athletics taught me the importance of resilience, discipline, and leadership—qualities that continue to shape my academic and professional life.

At Villanova, I was a **BIG EAST champion in the discus throw** and part of the **2021 BIG EAST championship team**. I also competed in the **2020 Canadian Olympic and Paralympic Trials** (held in 2021 due to COVID-19), qualifying in both the **discus** and **shot put**.

Today, I stay connected to the sport through **volunteer coaching** roles at **George Mason University** and **Villanova University**, where I mentor student-athletes and support their growth both on and off the field. Coaching gives me the opportunity to give back to a community that shaped me and to continue learning from the next generation of athletes.

Athletics has deeply informed my understanding of leadership, motivation, and institutional culture. These are topics I also explore in my academic work.
