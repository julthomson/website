Welcome to my research page! My research focuses on American political institutions, religious rhetoric, and elite behavior. I use a combination of quantitative text analysis, archival research, and case studies to explore how religion intersects with political communication and policymaking.

    <h3>Dissertation</h3>
    <p>
      My dissertation, <em>"Sacred Speech in a Secularizing Society: Congress, the President, and the Politics of Religious Rhetoric"</em>, examines how institutional roles and public religiosity shape elite use of religious language. I use a mixed-methods design to analyze presidential and congressional speech across two administrations.
