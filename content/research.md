My research explores the intersection of religion, political institutions, and elite behavior in the United States. I am especially interested in how political actors—particularly members of Congress and the presidency—use religious rhetoric in both policymaking and public engagement. My work draws on mixed methods, combining computational text analysis with case studies. You can learn more about my published work <a href="/publication/">on the Publications Page</a>.

## Dissertation

**Title**: *Sacred Speech in a Secularizing Society: Congress, the President, and the Politics of Religious Rhetoric*  
In an era of significant religious disaffiliation in America, the enduring and notable use of religious language by presidents and members of Congress presents a compelling paradox. My dissertation investigates how institutional roles, partisanship, and public religiosity shape these elite rhetorical strategies. I introduce a novel framework to study religious appeals, mapping them along two dimensions: the first distinguishing inclusive civil religion from exclusionary Christian nationalism, and the second differentiating ceremonial, non-mobilizing expressions from strategically mobilizing calls to action. Drawing on this framework, I conduct a large-scale computational text analysis of nearly five decades of presidential and congressional speech (1977–2025). I complement this textual analysis with an original survey experiment designed to assess how Americans perceive and respond to different types of religious rhetoric when delivered by varying institutional voices. Together, these mixed methods are designed to highlight the strategic deployment of religious appeals, offering critical insights into the evolving role of religion in American political communication, its impact on democratic representation, and its function within an increasingly pluralistic society. In doing so, I contribute to scholarship in political communication,religion and politics, and the study of American political institutions.
