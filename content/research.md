My research explores the intersection of religion, political institutions, and elite behavior in the United States. I am especially interested in how political actors—particularly members of Congress and the presidency—use religious rhetoric in both policymaking and public engagement. My work draws on mixed methods, combining computational text analysis with case studies. You can learn more about my published work <a href="/publication/">on the Publications Page</a>.

## Dissertation

**Title**: *Sacred Speech in a Secularizing Society: Congress, the President, and the Politics of Religious Rhetoric*  
My dissertation investigates how American political elites deploy religious language across institutional contexts. I focus on the presidency and Congress from 2000 to 2024, examining how institutional roles, partisanship, and public religiosity shape both the use and reception of religious rhetoric. The project contributes to our understanding of symbolic representation, elite communication, and the persistence of religious language in American politics. I use a combination of large-scale text analysis and case-based comparisons to trace how religious appeals vary across time, crisis, and political context.
