abstract: 'In an era defi ned by rising nationalism, authoritarianism, and religious funda-mentalism, protecting religious freedom has become a central global challenge. While  international  law  and  human  rights  frameworks  have  long  enshrined  the  principle  of  religious  liberty,  the  gap  between  global  commitments  and  national practices has widened, leaving religious minorities vulnerable to state and societal restrictions. Drawing on case studies from Nigeria, Egypt, Russia, France,  and  the  United  States,  we  show  that  both  government  policies  and  social hostilities shape restrictions on religious freedom across political systems and cultural contexts. Using comparative analysis of legal frameworks, interna-tional reports, and documented incidents of repression, we identify distinct yet interconnected pathways by which religion becomes a site of contestation over identity,  nationalism,  and  state  authority.  We  argue  that  restrictions,  whether  imposed by governments or reinforced by societal pressures, undermine social cohesion, exacerbate divisions, and threaten democratic governance. We con-clude that no single institutional model guarantees religious freedom, as even nation-states with strong legal protections struggle with deep internal confl icts over its meaning and scope.'
