#My work focuses on answering three questions: How does the distribution of public preferences impact the ability of leaders to engage in international bargaining? How do great powers navigate the relation between international orders and wars? Finally, what statistical tools can help political scientists manage data scarcity? I use formal and computational models to demonstrate the internal validity of my arguments and behavioral experiments and statistical methods to ensure their external validity.

## About Me

I am a fourth-year PhD candidate and Presidential Scholar in the Political Science program at the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University. 

Using quantitative text analysis and survey experiments, [my research](/research/) examines why American political elites continue to use religious rhetoric in an era of declining religiosity. I analyze how institutional roles, partisanship, and shifting religious demographics shape the rhetorical strategies of the president and Congress, as well as the implications of religious language in policy debates and public opinion. My broader academic interests include identity politics, political communication, and computational methods. My research has been supported by George Mason University's [Office of the Provost Presidential Scholars progam](https://graduate.gmu.edu/faculty-staff/supporting-graduate-students/presidential-scholars) and the Schar School of Policy and Government [Daniel Druckman Fellowship](https://schar.gmu.edu/why-study-here/scholarships-and-funding/scholarships-for-masters-phd/daniel-druckman_fellowship). 

Prior to my doctoral studies, I earned a BA in Religion from Dartmouth College and an MBA from Villanova University. [I also competed as a Division I student-athlete](/athletics/). My athletic career instilled in me a belief in the power of teamwork, discipline, and resilience, and these qualities continue to shape my academic and professional pursuits.

I love meeting new people and exchanging new ideas. If you'd like to chat about research, academia, athletics, or anything in between, feel free to reach out via email at jthomso4@gmu.edu.
